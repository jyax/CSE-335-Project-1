//Working with the idea of a switch case, currently trying
//to figure out where the commandevent function would be binded from

//Update - currently bound in GameView class for Level0 only
//works on event as anticipated, trying to figure out what this class would
//do with that information, or if that's the appropriate place for the function
//For clarity: added Line 21, and Lines 24-26 to GameView
